//! LUD-25 offline verification, and the address-registration proof.
//!
//! A SERVICE certifies each note it issues with its Lightning node identity
//! key (the same key it signs BOLT-11 invoices with), so a holder can confirm
//! a note's issuer and amount without contacting anyone. Signed via the
//! node's own signmessage RPC (lnd's `/v1/signmessage`, cln's `signmessage`),
//! which wraps the message with this prefix and double-SHA256s it before
//! signing. That is deliberate reuse: any tool that already verifies a
//! Lightning node's signed messages can verify a note.
//!
//! ```text
//! message = "LNURLcash:" || amount_msat (decimal ASCII) || ":" || hex(Q)
//! digest  = sha256(sha256("Lightning Signed Message:" || message))
//! ```
//!
//! `Q` is the note's taproot output key, for every kind of note: a bearer
//! note's `Q` is public too, so a SERVICE can certify one without disclosing
//! what spends it. A SERVICE from before notes were keyed by `Q` certified a
//! bearer note over its hash `h` instead, and those certificates are still
//! read, reported as [`CertifiedOver::LegacyHash`].
//!
//! A certificate proves issuance, not that the spend in hand opens the note:
//! a `ck1` states its `Q` in plain sight, so anyone who has seen a note's
//! `cp1` and `cs1` can pair them with a signature that opens nothing.
//! [`check_note`] makes both checks, which is why it needs the mint's domain.
